- **Bandwidth** is the number of bits per second that a link can send or receive, including all flows.
` eg. r4.xlarge has 800Mbps bandwidth `

- **Throughput**  is the actual amount of data that could be transferred through the network.
 throughput == Bandwidth

`eg. r4.xlarge has 100MBps Max throughput`
