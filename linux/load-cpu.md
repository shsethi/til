CPU load is measure of the amount of computational work.
Max value should be == Num of cores.

eg. If a single core machine has 1.00 load. That means it's running at total capacity

To get cpu load 1-min, 5-min, 15-min average use : 
```
$ uptime
```
    Output :   08:53:25 up 23:47,  1 user,  load average: 1.04, 1.06, 1.14
